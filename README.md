## Summary of API Specification

### Endpoint: Get Points

Response: A JSON object containing the number of points awarded.

Description
A simple Getter endpoint that looks up the receipt by the ID and returns an object specifying the points awarded.

Example Response:
`{ "points": 32 } `

### Rules
These rules collectively define how many points should be awarded to a receipt.
1. One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
2. 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
3. 25 points if the total is a multiple of 0.25.
4. 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
5. If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by 0.2 and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
6. 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
7. 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.
